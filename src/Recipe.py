Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).\n2. Wash the chicken thoroughly and pat it dry with paper towels.\n3. Cut one lemon into slices and set them aside. Squeeze the juice from the other lemon into a small bowl.\n4. In a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic cloves with a pinch of salt until you have a paste-like consistency.\n5. In a separate bowl, combine the garlic paste, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well.\n6. Rub the herb mixture all over the chicken, making sure to get it under the skin as well. Place a few lemon slices inside the cavity of the chicken.\n7. Transfer the chicken to a roasting pan and arrange the remaining lemon slices around it.\n8. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (75째C) and the skin is golden brown and crispy.\n9. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before carving."
